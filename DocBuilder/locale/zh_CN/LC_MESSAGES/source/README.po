"In normalized coordinate system, the origin (0, 0) lies on top left "

msgid "Local Coordinate System (local positioning)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/README.rst:430

"The aim of introducing local coordinate system is to express the "
"coordinates with reference to a certain UI elements. The origin (0,0) of "
"local coordinate system lies on the top left corner of UI bounding box, "
"x-axis goes horizontally rightward direction and y-axis goes vertically "
"downwards. The height and the width of UI element are chosen as 1 unit of"
" length. Coordinates are expressed as signed distances from the origin. "
"Other definitions are same as for normalized coordinate system."

"Local coordinate system is more flexible in order to locate the position "

" 1 or less than 0 correspond to the position out of the UI element."
